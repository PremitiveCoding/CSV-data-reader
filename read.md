**Controllers: csvController.js**

This is a Node.js function for creating sales records from a CSV file and storing them in a database using the MongoDB and Mongoose. The code is using the "fs" module to read the contents of the uploaded CSV file, the "fast-csv" module to parse the contents of the file into a series of records, and the "Sale" module to model and store these records in the database. When this function is called, it will read the contents of the uploaded file, parse the contents into individual records, and then store each record as a new document in the "sales" collection. The response will either return the created sales records or a status code of 400 and an error message, in case of any errors during the process.

**Routes : CsvRoutes.js**

This code is setting up an Express router and defining a single endpoint for uploading a CSV file. The endpoint will handle a single file and expects it to be named "csvFile" in the form data.

The code uses Multer, a library for handling `multipart/form-data` (i.e. file uploads), to handle the file upload. The `storage` variable sets up a custom storage destination for the uploaded file to the "public/csv" directory. If the "public" or "public/csv" directories do not already exist, they will be created. The filename of the uploaded file will be set to the current time concatenated with the original name of the file.

The `fileFilter` function is used to filter uploaded files and only allow files with a ".csv" extension. If a file with a different extension is uploaded, an error will be thrown.

The router has a single endpoint, `"/create"`, defined using the `.post` method. The endpoint uses the `upload.single` middleware from Multer to handle the file upload, and passes the control to the `csvController.create` function defined in another module.

Finally, the router is exported as a module to be used in another part of the application.

**Server index.js:**

The file you posted is a Node.js script using the Express framework. It sets up a web server that listens on port 4001. The script has several endpoints that perform aggregations on data stored in a MongoDB database. The database is connected to using Mongoose and the connection details are stored in a URI string.

The script sets up several routes for aggregations on a "Sale" model, including:

- Revenue by product line
- Total purchases by customer type
- Average rating by gender
- Sales by city
- Costs of purchases by product line

The script also sets up a route for uploading a CSV file. The uploaded file is processed by a "csvRoutes" module.

**_Frontend : revenue_by_productLine.js_**

The code is a React component that renders a horizontal bar chart using the Chart.js library. The component uses the "useEffect" hook to fetch data from an API and display it in the chart. The component uses the "useState" hook to keep track of the chart data, which is updated when the API call returns.

The component starts by importing the required libraries, including "ChartJS" from Chart.js, "Bar" from react-chartjs-2, and hooks such as "useEffect" and "useState".

It then sets the default options for the chart, such as the title text, the legend position, and the responsiveness of the chart.

The component then defines the "Horizontalchart" function which returns the chart. This function uses the "useState" hook to set the default state of the chart data and store any updates.

In the "useEffect" hook, the component makes an API call to the URL "[https://matious-api.vercel.app/revenue_by_productLine](https://matious-api.vercel.app/revenue_by_productLine)" and retrieves the data from the API. The component then processes the data by mapping the categories and their corresponding values to separate arrays. Finally, it sets the data for the chart by updating the state of the component.

The component returns the chart in a div element with a specified width and height. The "Bar" component from react-chartjs-2 is used to render the chart with the passed-in data and options.

Finally, the component exports the "Horizontalchart" function as the default export.
